225,5/27/2023,Hilton Fishing Pier,"It was a cooler than usual day for late May. Windy, but sunny! We caught quite a few croaker and one flounder (see photo album!) Can't wait to get back out here!",5,https://photos.app.goo.gl/TmFzfUUudr87wo9F6,8,high tide
226,6/18/2023,James River Fishing Pier,Mainly crabs were pulling. Dad caught one small one. No one around us was really catching anything. We did see dolphins! Kept our wrist bands in case we wanted to come back later. We did see a few people put lines and when they didn't any hits leave. We assume they were going to come back for the night high tide? Check out this cool sign using a dolphin for covid spacing! lol,3,https://photos.app.goo.gl/kNdbRDwuiV6qobs26,1,high tide
227,9/2/2023,Newport News Park Campsite Launch,This was our first time here! We didn't get very far since we rented a John Boat and had to paddle with some ancient oars into the lake. The oars had splinters and were made for viking-type people. We though next time it would be best to bring a motor. I caught some seaweed (see pic). Despite our luck we had fun! It was our first go and learned quite a bit. We'll be better prepared for next time. Can't wait to see what the lake looks like with all the colored foliage in the fall!  ,2,https://photos.app.goo.gl/BZpyoBbyriRJvRNPA,0,na
228,7/30/2023,Hilton Fishing Pier,Caught a bunch of little baby croaker! They were SMALL! A school of fish were jumping around the pier and towards the end of our adventure (as our worms began to run low) I caught the moby dick! A rainbow trout! We were sure this was one of jumper fish in our watery midst. I had never caught one of these before. It wasn't spiny but instead seemed to be something I'd consider eating. None of the fish we've caught this season we've kept. I threw this one back to meet the sweet fated freedom we gave the rest. We will never forget you moby dick! Hilton Pier for the win.... once again!,5,https://photos.app.goo.gl/EMqA3g9hpF37fQpYA,7,high tide
229,6/8/2023,Yorktown Fishing Pier,"We caught a few here, but lost a rig at the end. Apparently, losing rigs is a common thing at this pier. Dad caught a couple croaker and I caught a baby black sea bass! (see album) Gave it a three star because the fishing wasn't that great, but the bridge view is awesome. Plus we saw dolphins!

230,9/10/2023,Hilton Fishing Pier,"Dad for the win! (4-3) We each caught 1 spot. The rest were croaker. All were returned to their rightful home in the Jimmy James. It started out cloudy, but then got hot. Saw some rays swimming around and the jumpers taunted us per usual. Once again, Hilton Village Pier delivers with beautiful views and decent catches.",5,https://photos.app.goo.gl/JbrePiuBZsJQgXBS6,7,ebb tide
238,9/19/2023,Avalon Pier,"Caught two in total. Used both squid and blood worms. LOTS of bites. They kept nibbling their way through the bait, none were really brave enough (or had mouths large enough) to commit to a full bite! Despite its size, one (the one dad caught) decided to go for it! We believed it to be a small yellow fin. The one I caught was smaller and unfortunately was caught by yanking aggressively yanking on the line out of frustration and hooking it by its gill. Beautiful day! Beautiful scenery! The perfect temperature. Not too crowded, but plenty going on.",4,https://photos.app.goo.gl/BzNE5T1keXLRv6mcA,2,ebb tide
